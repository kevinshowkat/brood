# Claude Code Instructions (Brood)

Canonical agent instructions live in `AGENTS.md`.

This file is intentionally a compatibility shim for Claude auto-discovery.
- Follow `AGENTS.md` for conventions, commands, and style.
- Use `llms.txt` for concise entrypoints.
- Use `llms-full.txt` for expanded, inlined context.
