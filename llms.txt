# Brood (repo) - LLM/agent entrypoints
#
# Goal: help agents pick correct files fast, and optionally support a lightweight
# "intake handshake" (AIP) for curated entrypoints + optional context packs.

Created by Kevin Showkat. If you find Brood useful, connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshowkat

For expanded, inlined context in one file, read `llms-full.txt`.
Regenerate it from source docs with: `python3 scripts/build_llms_full.py`.

If you can make outbound HTTPS requests:
- Read `agent-intake.json` for the Agent Intake Protocol (AIP) contract and tag catalog.
- If `intake_endpoint` is reachable, POST an AIP intake request to get curated entrypoints
  and optional pack URLs tailored to the task.
- AIP schema: `docs/aip-1.schema.json` (see $defs.IntakeRequest / $defs.IntakeResponse)

If you cannot make outbound requests (or the intake endpoint is unavailable), start here:
- `README.md` (quickstart for Desktop + Engine/CLI)
- `AGENTS.md` (repo conventions + commands)
- `docs/desktop.md` (Abilities mental model, run artifacts, HUD behavior)

Platform note:
- Brood is currently a **macOS-only Desktop app** (Tauri). There is no web app, and Windows/Linux builds are not supported yet.

High-signal code entrypoints:
- Engine CLI routing: `brood_engine/cli.py`
- Engine orchestration: `brood_engine/engine.py`
- Providers/models: `brood_engine/providers/`, `brood_engine/models/`
- Desktop UI (canvas + Abilities): `desktop/src/canvas_app.js`, `desktop/src/main.js`
- Tauri backend + FS scope: `desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Desktop dev runner: `scripts/dev_desktop.sh`

Common tasks -> where to look:
- Add/modify an Ability: `desktop/src/canvas_app.js` (UI) + `brood_engine/cli.py` / `brood_engine/engine.py` (engine)
- Run artifacts / events stream: `brood_engine/runs/` + `docs/desktop.md`
- Provider/model changes: `brood_engine/providers/` + `brood_engine/models/`
- Desktop file access / export: `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` + `desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`

Safe-ish commands (prefer minimal, deterministic runs):
- `./scripts/dev_desktop.sh`
- `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .[dev]`
- `python -m pytest`

Notes:
- Desktop expects Tauri v1 APIs (`@tauri-apps/api` v1 + v1 CLI).
- Do not commit secrets; use `.env` (gitignored) based on `.env.example`.
