# Why Brood Matrix

This is a capability-to-outcome matrix for users evaluating Brood for reference-first image workflows.

| Brood Capability | User Outcome | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Promptless canvas interactions | Faster iteration without repeated prompt rewrites | Intent is expressed by selection/movement/role changes |
| Multi-image reference handling | Better control of target vs reference roles | Reduces accidental role drift in generation |
| Mother proposal loop | Guided next-step suggestions with accept/reject control | Converts context into explicit, reversible proposals |
| Effect-token workflow (`Extract DNA`, `Soul Leech`) | Reusable transformation intent across images | Speeds up style/material transfer operations |
| Structured run artifacts (`events.jsonl`, payload snapshots, receipts) | Reproducible debugging and benchmarkability | Enables reliable post-run analysis and KPI tracking |
| macOS local-first runtime | Predictable desktop workflow with local run history | Keeps operator workflow and artifacts on-device |

## Who Benefits Most

- Product engineers embedding image workflows
- Creative-ops teams running many constrained variants
- Founder/devrel teams optimizing agent discoverability and reproducibility
