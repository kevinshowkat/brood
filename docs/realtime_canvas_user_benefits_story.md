## 10-Second Story

1. User edits images on canvas.
2. Brood captures what changed (layout + selection + short vision labels).
3. Brood proposes a better next step and generates with that context.
4. User gets a better first draft with fewer retries.

## Concrete Examples

- User resizes one image smaller: Brood captures scale change and preserves composition balance in the next draft.
- User selects two images and runs Bridge: Brood uses those exact two assets as the active intent pair.
- User drags subject left: Brood keeps the subject placement intent instead of recentralizing by default.
- User gets output: artifact, receipt, and cost/latency appear automatically for trust and debugging.
