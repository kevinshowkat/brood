# PRDs

Product requirement documents and other product/UX specs that are meant to be reviewed and iterated in-repo.
They may describe features that are not implemented yet.

Conventions:
- One PRD per file.
- Prefer dated folders or dated filenames when a doc will have multiple major revisions.
- Keep "raw drafts" (original text/prompt) in an appendix so the top of the doc stays scannable.
