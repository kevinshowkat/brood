    "prompt": "Late-90s RTS unit-portrait aesthetic, low-res pre-rendered 3D, chunky pixels, dithering, CRT scanlines, subtle VHS noise, slight chromatic aberration, 15 fps feel. Head-and-shoulders portrait centered with generous safe margins, keep all important motion in the center 60% so a square crop still works. Exaggerated character design with clearly pseudo-human proportions: larger-than-life facial features, strong silhouettes, heroic jawlines, slightly uncanny 90s CGI vibe, gritty armor and gear. Single continuous shot, no cuts. Seamless loop (end pose matches start). Cockpit/console background with blinking lights and abstract HUD shapes, but no readable text. No logos, no watermarks, no subtitles. Original character design only; do not mimic any specific movie/game character. No recognizable StarCraft characters/factions. No spoken words; optional faint radio static only. Mood: stunningly awe-inspiring and tearfully joyous. IDLE state: subtle breathing, blinking, tiny eye saccades, micro head movement. Console lights flicker but no big hologram transformations; nothing dramatic changes in the scene. An East Asian analyst (adult) with a split-color visor (cool cyan on one side, deep blue on the other) and two asymmetrical ocular modules. Two small holograms remain steady and quiet. The unit alternates gaze left/right, gentle breathing, one blink; no major scene changes.",
