    "prompt": "Late-90s RTS unit-portrait aesthetic, low-res pre-rendered 3D, chunky pixels, dithering, CRT scanlines, subtle VHS noise, slight chromatic aberration, 15 fps feel. Head-and-shoulders portrait centered with generous safe margins, keep all important motion in the center 60% so a square crop still works. Exaggerated character design with clearly pseudo-human proportions: larger-than-life facial features, strong silhouettes, heroic jawlines, slightly uncanny 90s CGI vibe, gritty armor and gear. Single continuous shot, no cuts. Seamless loop (end pose matches start). Cockpit/console background with blinking lights and abstract HUD shapes, but no readable text. No logos, no watermarks, no subtitles. Original character design only; do not mimic any specific movie/game character. No recognizable StarCraft characters/factions. No spoken words; optional faint radio static only. Mood: stunningly awe-inspiring and tearfully joyous. WORKING state: the unit is clearly doing hands-on work with visible tooling (wrench, screwdriver, diagnostic probe, soldering iron, micro blowtorch, cable crimper). Small readable motions near the center of frame; occasional controlled sparks or vapor allowed. Keep the action loopable so the end matches the start. A swarm-born bio-synthetic test-range operator (adult) with chitin shoulder plates and a simple visor. Action: uses a diagnostic probe in one hand and toggles one chunky switch with the other. A wireframe hologram preview flickers on, jitters, then snaps back to the blank calibration grid. Tiny controlled sparks when the probe touches a contact; end pose matches the starting pose.",
